            Reigning Qatar Stars League champions Al Sadd clinched their second trophy of the season —
            the Qatar Cup — after edging arch-enemies Al Duhail 3-2 in a thrilling penalty shoot-out at the
            Jassim bin Hamad Stadium on Saturday.
        </p>
        <p>
            The two teams had been tied 2-2 at the end of regular time before Sadd went on to clinch their
            fourth Qatar Cup title in history.
        </p>
        <p>
            Qatar Olympic Committee President HE Sheikh Joaan bin Hamad Al Thani crowned the winners and handed
            over the coveted trophy to Al Sadd captain Hassan Al Haydos.
        </p>
        <p>
            Al Sadd coach Felix Sanchez praised his players for the tough win.
        </p>
        <p>
            “We played a strong match against a strong team. We were behind twice and came back. I think we
            deserved the title. It was an enjoyable match for everyone. It went to penalties, and I’m really
            happy with the players, their performance, and their comeback,” he said.
        </p>
        <p>
            He was all praise for goalkeeper Barsham.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Barsham was a star. We said if it went to penalties, he would help us and he did. He did it with the
            national team, and now again with Al Sadd,” Sanchez, who trained Qatar during the 2022 FIFA World Cup, said.
